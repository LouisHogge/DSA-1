# Data structure and algorithms Project 1: Selection algorithms

## Project Description
The aim of the project is to implement, theoretically analyze and empirically compare different selection algorithms, i.e. algorithms that find the kth smallest value from a set of values in a certain order.

## How to Use the Project
Use *Makefile*.
